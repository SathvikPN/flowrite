# SQLite Database Files Explained

- **flowrite.db**  
  This is the main SQLite database file. It stores all your tables, data, and schema.

- **flowrite.db-wal**  
  This is the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) file. When SQLite is in WAL mode, all changes are first written to this file for better concurrency and performance. The changes are later merged into the main database file.

- **flowrite.db-shm**  
  This is the shared memory file used by SQLite in WAL mode. It helps coordinate access and caching between different database connections.

**Summary:**  
- `flowrite.db` — main database  
- `flowrite.db-wal` — recent changes (write-ahead log)  
- `flowrite.db-shm` — shared memory for coordination

You should keep all three files together for the database to work correctly in WAL mode.



## Testing 

- visitor see first time welcome screen. description and footer sticky to bottom and no overlaps. both screens (desktop and smartphone)
- start writing > write page 
- export working with all whitespace newlines preserved
- shelf or login takes to login page
- TODO: logs are crowded, multiple logs.
- invalid login username password error fine
- register page mismatched pwd fine. 
- proper register > login page
